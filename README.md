# Final Capstone Project Front-End: English Wise

This project is a requirement of the Microverse curriculum. Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections.

English wise is an appoinment app to schedule a meeting with an english teacher. This respository contains the back-end for the English Wise App. For this project I use the [english wise front-end](https://github.com/nriqu322/english-wise) as the front-end. I use Ruby on Rails to build this project.

If you feel curious you can check the [project requirements](https://www.notion.so/Final-Capstone-Project-Book-an-Appointment-41ded2ee99ff4fe4becf91acb332ca26).
